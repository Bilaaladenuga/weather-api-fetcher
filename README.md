## Usage

### Basic Example
Here is a simple example of how to use API Fetcher:

```javascript
const { ApiFetcher } = require('./path/to/api-fetcher');

const fetcher = new ApiFetcher({
    baseURL: 'https://api.example.com',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN',
    },
});

fetcher.get('/endpoint')
    .then(response => {
        console.log(response.data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error.message);
    });
```

### Available Methods
- `get(url, params)`: Sends a GET request.
- `post(url, data)`: Sends a POST request.
- `put(url, data)`: Sends a PUT request.
- `delete(url)`: Sends a DELETE request.

### Configuration Options
- **baseURL:** The base URL for the API.
- **headers:** Default headers to include in every request.
- **timeout:** Request timeout duration in milliseconds.

### Advanced Usage
#### Custom Request Interceptors
You can add custom interceptors to modify requests before they are sent:

```javascript
fetcher.addRequestInterceptor(config => {
    console.log('Request sent:', config);
    return config;
});
```

#### Custom Response Interceptors
You can also add custom interceptors to process responses:

```javascript
fetcher.addResponseInterceptor(response => {
    console.log('Response received:', response);
    return response;
});
```
